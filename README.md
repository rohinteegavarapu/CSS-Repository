# CSS-Repository
Use this repository if there's anything (probably code) you want the board or anyone else in the club to see, or to save your CSS projects to download on different devices.

# UPDATE
I've added Gitpod as a third party app to the repository. This app is an IDE that has access to all files within this repository, where you can edit said files.
CHANGES DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY COMMIT TO THE REPOSITORY.
YOU NEED TO INSTALL COMPILERS ON YOUR DEVICE TO USE GITPOD.
Once you're done in GitPod, download the file, and reupload to the GitHub repository. 
It is NOT fully configured yet.
